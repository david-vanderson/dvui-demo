This branch is for trying to get raylib stuff working with wasm/emscripten.

`zig build raylib-ontop -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`



# DVUI Examples

This repo serves as an example for how to integrate [dvui](https://github.com/david-vanderson/dvui).

- `zig build sdl3-app` or `zig build raylib-app`
  - you want to build a new app
  - you want dvui to handle the mainloop

- `zig build sdl3-standalone` or `zig build raylib-standalone`
  - you want to build a new app
  - dvui will paint the whole window
  - use this repo's build.zig and build.zig.zon as a starting point

- `zig build sdl3-ontop` or `zig build raylib-ontop`
  - you already have an app or game
  - you want to add some gui stuff (like floating windows to for debugging)
  - use this example for integration

- `zig build web-app`
  - you want to put an app or game in a web canvas
